# What is npm?

npm opens up an entire world of JavaScript talent for you and your team. It's the world's largest software registry, with approximately 3 billion downloads per week. The registry contains over 600,000 _packages_ (building blocks of code). Open-source developers from every continent use npm to share and borrow packages, and many organizations use npm to manage private development as well. 

Here is a quick introduction to npm:

npm consists of three distinct components:

*  the website
*  the Command Line Interface (CLI)
*  the registry

Use the [*website*](https://npmjs.com) to discover packages, set up profiles, and manage other aspects of your npm experience. For example, you can set up [Orgs](https://www.npmjs.com/features) (organizations) to manage access to public or private packages. 

The [*CLI*](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/npm) runs from a terminal. This is how most developers interact with npm. 

The [*registry*](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/registry) is a large public database of JavaScript software and the meta-information surrounding it. 


## Use npm to . . . 

* Adapt packages of code to your apps, or incorporate packages as they are.
* Download standalone tools you can use right away.
* Run packages without downloading using [npx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npx).
* Share code with any npm user, any where.
* Restrict code to specific developers.
* Form Orgs (organizations) to coordinate package maintenance, coding, and developers.  
* Form virtual teams by using Orgs.
* Manage multiple versions of code and code dependencies.
* Update applications easily when underlying code is updated.
* Discover multiple ways to solve the same puzzle. 
* Find other developers who are working on similar problems and projects.   

These are just a few examples of ways developers use npm. If you'd like to add a bullet point, comment [here](https://github.com/npm/docs/issues/944).   

## Where do I Start?

Now that you know what npm is, and a bit about how to use it, it's time to get started. 

### Your First Package Page

First, you create an npm account, which is explained in the next chapter. You will then have you own page on npmjs.com, which will be http://www.npmjs.com/~*yourusername*.

<!--<<img src="first-package-page.png" style="border: 1px solid gray;">-->

As you publish packages, they will appear on your page. You can add organizations to invite others to work with you. 

After you set up an npm account, the next step is to use the commmand line interface (CLI) to [install npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node). We look forward to seeing what you create!

## How do I share packages or collaborate with others?  

If you choose to share your packages publicly, there is no cost. To use and share private packages, you need to upgrade your account. To share with others, create organizations, called **npm Orgs**,  and invite others to work with you, privately (for a fee) or publicly (for free). Or you can sign up for a custom, private type of npm for your company, called **npmE** for npm Enterprise.

## Learn more about npm Orgs and npmE

[npm Orgs](https://www.npmjs.com/features) provide tools for managing both public and private packages. Granting permissions is easy, and configuration is simplified.

If you would prefer to have your own private registry, so that you can develop packages internally that are not shared publicly,  consider [npm Enterprise](https://www.npmjs.com/enterprise).

### CLI Reference Doc / Online Help

While relevant CLI commands are covered throughout this user documentation, the CLI includes command line help, its own [documentation section, and instant help (man pages)](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/help). When you click a doc about [any CLI command](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/help-search), a list of all CLI commands appears in the left-hand side bar. You can also access the list of CLI commands by scrolling to CLI Commands on the [docs home page](https://docs.npmjs.com).
