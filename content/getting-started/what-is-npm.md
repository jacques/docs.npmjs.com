# What is npm?

npm opens up an entire world of JavaScript talent to you and to your team. It's the world's largest software registry, with approximately 3 billion downloads per week.The registry contains over 600,000 _packages_ (building blocks of code).  Open-source developers from every continent use npm to share and borrow packages. Packages are structured to enable you to keep track of dependencies and versions. 

Here is a quick introduction to npm:

npm consists of three distinct components:

*  the website
*  the registry
*  the Command Line Interface (CLI)

The [*website*](https://npmjs.com) is the primary way developers discover packages, set up profiles, and manage other aspects of their npm experience.

The *registry* is a large database of information about packages.

The [*CLI*](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/npm) runs from a terminal. This is how most developers interact with npm.

## Use npm to . . . 

* Adapt packages to your apps, or incorporate them as they are.

* Download standalone tools you can use right away.

* Run packages without downloading using [npx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npx).

* Share code with any npm user, any where.

* Restrict code to specific developers.

* Form virtual teams (orgs).

* Manage multiple versions of code and code dependencies.

* Update applications easily when underlying code is updated.

* Discover multiple ways to solve the same puzzle. 

* Find other developers who are working on similar problems.  

These are just a few examples of ways developers use npm. If you'd like to add a bullet point, comment [here](https://github.com/npm/docs/issues/944).   

## How to Find Packages

To find packages, start with the npm [search bar](https://www.npmjs.com).

While browsing, you'll find:

*  node modules, which can be used on the server side.
*  packages that add commands for you to use in the command line.
*  packages that can be used on the front end of websites.  

(To understand the difference between node modules and packages, click [here](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/packages)).

### Example: Finding a Package

For example, suppose you wanted to use bar codes (QR codes) in your application. Rather than spend weeks figuring out how to do this, why not see if someone has posted a package that creates QR codes? Start by entering a value in the search bar:

![blanksearchbar](/images/search-bar-qr-scanner-what-is-npm.png)

Related options will appear:

![choicessearchbar](/images/search-results-qr-what-is-npm.png)

Or, click, to filter the possibilities even more:

![filtersearchbar](/images/search-qr-what-is-npm.png)

When you choose a package to explore, more information appears. This information is written by the package author(s) so details vary.

![searchresults](/images/page-results-qr-scanner-what-is-npm.png)

Now, you can read the developer's instructions to discover how to use this package.

## Next Steps

Now that you know what npm is, and a bit about how to use it, it's time to get started.  [Install npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node). We look forward to seeing what you will create!
